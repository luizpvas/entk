# Entk - Enterprise Toolkit

I've been working with enterprisy software for the past 6 years and I've noticed some common patterns along the way. This library is an attempt to abstract those patterns. Here they are:

* Reports
	Different aggregates from different perspectives with a lot of different filters applied.
	Building new reports or adding more options to existing ones should be really simple.

* Usage tracking
	It's not unsual for a company to ask for a report about how long their employees spend
	on the app, and what they were doing. I don't agree with this practice, but it happens
	and it's not as easy as one might think to get it right.
